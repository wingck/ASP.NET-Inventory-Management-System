I am making an inventory database for supermarket. It has two tables, one is item table, for recording the number of items in a store. The other one is purchase table. It is used to record each purchase made by customers. Their relationship is one-to-many.

I have finished CRUD of both tables, with a little style css. All the basic functions are added successfully.

However, my original plan was after making a new purchase, the item number in the item table will be substracted automatically by the purchase number. If I can make it, I do not have to update each item everytime when a purchase is made. I am still figuring out how to make it. Thank you!!!
