I am making an inventory database for supermarket. It has two tables, one is item table, for recording the number of items in a store. The other one is purchase table. It is used to record each purchase made by customers. Their relationship is one-to-many.

I have finished CRUD of both tables, with a little style css. All the basic functions are added successfully.

I have created a trigger in purchase table in T-sql. ItemID is the primary key for item table and foreign key for purchase table.
Once a new purchase is made, the item number having the same ItemID with the purchase will be subtracted by the purchase number.
Therefore, the item table will be updated automatically.
